"""

The broker manages a simple publish/subscribe service.
Events are registerd with the broker at start of day.
Any module may then publish or subscribe to event types.

There is no queue mechanism implemented but this is a possible future
enhancement. At present, incoming messages are immediately dispatched
synchronously to each subscriber in turn. Events therefore arrive at a
subscriber on the thread of the caller. The subscriber must ensure that
they return from the call as quickly as possible and execute in a thread
safe manner.
